# improved_LiDAR_ground_detection
This project aimed to improve ground elevation estimation from GEDI LiDAR data. Ground elevations from LVIS LiDAR data were used as ground truth to train a convolutional neural network. The model incorporated NASADEM as ancillary data and reduced the RMSE of ground elevation estimates by 32 centimeters (8%).
